### CONCLUSION: ###

All in all this project has been pretty interesing and helpful. If you remember my story about the job in NY then now I can say that knowing all this would have been a life-saver. Obviously, version control and doing work in small recreatable segments is the way to go. Writing clear commit along with readme etc also is a very important skill if anyone but you is also going to see the project. I am sure I am going to use these skills a lot going forward. Thanks Professor Sanchez!
