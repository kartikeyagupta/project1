### INTRODUCTION: ###

To write this paper, I have used the tools mentioned below:  
- Git - A VCS used for software development and version control tasks. Free - Open source  
- GitHub - Web based service that integrates Git with a very beautiful and funtional GUI. It also adds its own feature that some might appreciate.  
- Pandoc - Free, Open Source. Software document converter. We used it with .md, .HTML and .pdf files.  
- bash - Bourne Again Shell. Unix shell and command language that is used to interact with the Kernel.  
- Make - A file that contains a set of directives used to build an automation tool. (Wikipedia) We essentially write bash code that when run through make file, will automate certain actions. It also has time-stamps which allow for efficient execution of files.  
- markdown - A way to write text can be exasily translated in HTML or PDF. It is the simplest form of writting documents in the technology world.  
- Sublime Text 2 - Text editor - Where you can write code for multiple extentions.  

As mentioned, this paper is about how to write a paper and hence I will talk about how i used these tools and why to create what I created. 

The structure of the project is:

The code is hosted on Github. This page that you are reading was created by the pandoc turning .md into a .html. In the discussion, I will go deeper into why, what how and anser a few extra questions about the project. Be sure to follow on,
