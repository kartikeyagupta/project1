STATISTICS 159 - Project 1

Author: Kartikeya Gupta

Overview: This is project 1 where the goal is to learn the basic tools taught by the class. These tools are used for the creation of Project 1, which in turn is a project 1 describing how to use these tools. Confusing right?! It's pretty simple. We'll see that soon.

Goal: (as stated in the requirements) 
The goal of this project assignment is to practice with the computational tools covered so far in the course: bash, markdown, pandoc, git, github, Make, and a text editor of your preference.

Tools used:
- Git - A VCS used for software development and version control tasks. Free - Open source
- GitHub - Web based service that integrates Git with a very beautiful and funtional GUI. It also adds its own feature that some might appreciate.
- Pandoc - Free, Open Source. Software document converter. We used it with .md, .HTML and .pdf files
- bash - Bourne Again Shell. Unix shell and command language that is used to interact with the Kernel.
- Make - A file that contains a set of directives used to build an automation tool. (Wikipedia) We essentially write bash code that when run through make file, will automate certain actions. It also has time-stamps which allow for efficient execution of files.
- markdown - A way to write text can be exasily translated in HTML or PDF. It is the simplest form of writting documents in the technology world.
- Sublime Text 2 - Text editor - Where you can write code for multiple extentions.
- Decaying Brain!


Details:
As mentioned above, this project is about learning tools and documenting the expereince through the way. For example, I want to learn how to use markdown. To learn this, I am actually creating a README file in the .md way. Similarly, we will use other tools to finish this project and document it. 

Structure: (as directed by Professor)

......markdown-logo.png  
......pandoc-logo.png  
......stat159-logo.png 

This essentially outlines the structure of the project. We have a README file - which contains the basic information about the product. The Makefile contains the automation commands to create certain files and link documents. The paper folder is where raw information goes into different categories about the paper which are individually stored and editted. The images folder is simply for storing images that will go into the paper.

Execution:
If you would like to test this project. You can download or close it from github. Then use "make" in terminal to run the makefile which will create the paper.md and paper.html. Ta da!
